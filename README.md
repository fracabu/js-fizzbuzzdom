# js-fizzbuzzdom

`js-fizzbuzzdom` is a simple web-based application that brings the classic FizzBuzz game to life directly within the browser's Document Object Model (DOM). It dynamically generates a grid of elements, populating them with numbers and the "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" labels based on the standard FizzBuzz rules. This project serves as a clear demonstration of basic HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript's ability to manipulate the DOM for interactive content.
